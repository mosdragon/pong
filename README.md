<h3>HTML5 and JavaScript based pong game</h3>

Developed with the help of a CM upperclassman at Georgia Tech teaching newbies how to effectively use the canvas tag in HTML5. The controls are just the W and S keys for player 1, up & down keys for player 2. The game isn't perfect and it unfortunately cannot keep track of scores (yet!).
